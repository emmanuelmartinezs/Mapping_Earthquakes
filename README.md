# Mapping Earthquakes 
## Overview of Project
> Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Overview of ES6+
ECMAScript, also referred to as "ES," is a scripting language designed to help standardize JavaScript. This means that ES provides guidelines and rules for JavaScript to follow, such as how a function should be created to run correctly, also known as the **proper syntax**.

Because ES has provided standardization for JavaScript, it also brings updates to the language. There are updates to every major coding language that fix bugs, update code, and provide overall quality of life improvements for the developers. ES6 is no exception!

There have been many updates to ES over the years, though the sixth update was a major one. You'll probably see "ES6+" mentioned out in the wild pretty often; this is a reference to the "big" update (ES6) as well as the later ones. It's also commonly known as "ES2015" or "ECMAScript 2015." (It was such an important update that it's even known by its year!) There are quite a few different ways to reference this language, but we'll be referring to it as ES6, JavaScript, or JS in this project.

## Benefits of the ES6 Update
We've briefly mentioned that the ES6 update was useful, but let's talk a bit more about why it was such a big deal.

Imagine two laptops, one old and one new, side by side. They're similar enough: they're close in size and shape and can complete many of the same tasks, but the newer laptop has an edge. It is faster and can perform tasks with greater efficiency than the older model.

JavaScript after the ES6 update is like the newer computer. This update included many updates to the syntax, which streamlined the code and made it easier to both read and write. Additional, quality of life improvements were implemented as well, such as adding Python-like generators and `for...of` loops. Even functions were updated and streamlined!

# Functional JavaScript

## The map() Method

The `map()` method in JavaScript applies a transformation to each element in an array. Like a for loop, it can perform an operation to every element of an array.

Here is an example in which all the numbers of an array are doubled:

````java
var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
var doubled = numbers.map(function(num){
    return num * 2;
});
console.log(doubled);
````

In this code, an array named `numbers` contains five integers:`var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];`. Let's break down the rest of the code in more detail:

- The `numbers` array calls the `map()` method.
- Inside the `map()` method, there is another function. This function is anonymous, meaning that the function does not have a name. When `map()` is called, it in turn calls this anonymous function.
- The anonymous function takes a parameter, named `num`, and returns the number multiplied by 2. Its sole task is to perform this single action.
- For every element in the array, the `map()` method calls the anonymous function, which doubles the value of the element.
- The `map()` method returns an array of doubled values, which is assigned the variable `doubled`.

Here, the `map()` function becomes a method of the `numbers` array. It then takes in an anonymous function whose sole task is to double the value of num, its argument.

Behind the scenes, an iterative process similar to a `for` loop takes place. The anonymous function takes in each integer of the `numbers` array and doubles it. Finally, the variable `doubled` is an array of integers whose values are twice their original values.

Try running the code in your browser console and view the results for doubled. You should see the following:

![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/Plotly/blob/main/Resources/Images/s1.png?raw=true)


## The filter() Method

Another functional programming technique is the `filter()` method. Like the map() method, it accepts another function as its parameter. Like `map()`, `filter()` performs an operation on every element in the original array. Unlike `map()`, however, `filter()` does not necessarily return an array whose length is the same as the original array.

Let's see what this means in an example. Run the following code in your console. What does `larger` return?

````java
var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

var larger = numbers.filter(function(num){
    return num > 1;
});

console.log(larger);
````

It returns an array of integers that are larger than 1: `[2,3,4,5]`.This example is remarkably similar to the last one, with one major difference.

First, the similarities:

- The `numbers` array uses the `filter()` method.
- The `filter()` method, in turn, takes an anonymous function as its argument. The anonymous function's sole task is to take in a parameter, called `num`.

The `filter()` method operates on each element of the `numbers` array. So how does it differ from `map()`?

The `map()` method transforms every element of the original array, and so the size of the transformed array is the same as that of the original array.

The `filter()` method, on the other hand, returns an array of values that meet certain criteria. Values in the original array that do not fulfill the condition are filtered out. In this case, specifically, the anonymous function called by `filter()` returns `true` if an argument is larger than 1, and false if it does not. The `filter()` method runs the anonymous function on every element of the original `numbers` array. Only numbers that are larger than 1 are returned: `[2,3,4,5]`. So whereas applying `map()` to the numbers array would have returned an array with five elements, applying this specific filter returned an array of only four elements.


## The Arrow Functions

Let's do a quick review of arrow functions. An arrow function in JavaScript is syntactic sugar. That is, an arrow function does the same thing as a standard JavaScript function, but it streamlines the syntax used to accomplish the same task.  

The anonymous function inside `map()` and `filter()` can be simplified as an arrow function. Here's an example:

````java
var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];


var doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled);
````

The `map()` method performs the identical operation as before: it doubles each element in the `numbers` array. However, the anonymous function inside `map()` has been replaced by an arrow function. Contrast the two:

````java
var familyAge = [3,2,39,37,9];
var sortedAge = familyAge.sort((a,b) => a - b);
console.log(sortedAge);
````

`sortedAge` returns the array `[2,3,9,37,39]`. Like `map()` and `filter()`, `sort()` takes in an anonymous function. During each iteration, the anonymous function, an arrow function in this case, compares one element of the array `(a)` with another element in the array `(b)`. From `a`, it subtracts `b`. If the result is negative (i.e., `b` is larger than `a`) then it stays put. If the result of the subtraction is positive, the order of the two elements is reversed. Look at a modified version of this example.


## The slice() Method

Roza also needs to be able to select a subset of the data. In her project, for example, she might perform a transformation on an array, filter it, sort it, and then display only the top five results.

````java
var integers = [0,1,2,3,4,5];
var slice1 = integers.slice(0,2);
````

In this example, the `slice()` method returns the first two elements of the `integer` array: `[0,1]`. The first argument is the position of where to begin the selection. Here, it is at index position 0. The next argument, 2, denotes the position of the array where the slicing ceases. In other words, the `slice()` method begins selecting the array at index position 0, and stops right before reaching index position 2. So here, it returns elements at index positions 0 and 1, but not 2.

# Deliverable 1:  
## Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
### Deliverable Requirements:
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the `sample_values` as the values, the `otu_ids` as the labels, and the `otu_labels` as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

Your bar chart should look like the following image:

![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/Plotly/blob/main/Resources/Images/s2.png?raw=true)



1. Code is written to create the arrays when a sample is selected from the dropdown menu.
2. Code is written to create the trace object in the `buildCharts()` function, and it contains the following:
    - The y values are the `otu_ids` in descending order.
    - The x values are the `sample_values` in descending order
    - The hover text is the `otu_labels` in descending order.
3. â€‹Code is written to create the layout array in the `buildCharts()` function that creates a title for the chart.
4. When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, **ID 940**â€™s data should be displayed in the dashboard, and the bar chart has the following:
    - The top 10 `sample_values` are sorted in descending order
    - The top 10 `sample_values` as values
    - The `otu_ids` as the labels
